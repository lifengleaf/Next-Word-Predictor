This is an online Next Word Predictor (NWP), built as the capstone project of [Data Science Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project/).

Before using the model, it will take you about 20 seconds to load the data. **Start when you see "input something.."**.
 
When you input a sequence of English words in the textbox, you'll get a list of predicted next word, ordered by conditional probability which the model assigns.

If you input more than two words, the NWP will keep only the last two for prediction.

There are two special marks in the output list: `<num>` for digital numbers , while`<eos>` is end of sentence mark to replace punctuation `!.?:`.

For more information, you can turn to next tab "how does it work", or the code on [Github](https://github.com/lifengleaf/capstone).
